## Scientific Foundation

SYNTRIAD is grounded in formal theory and empirical validation:

| Paper | Pillar | DOI |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Self-Validating Systems | Conceptual | [![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-10.5281%2Fzenodo.17616682-blue.svg)](https://zenodo.org/records/17616682) |

See [`theory/`](theory/) for the mathematical foundations.
See [`evidence/`](evidence/) for empirical validation.

## Core

A minimal transformation:

```
T : (S, I, C) → S'
```

A current state **S** is transformed into a new state **S'**, guided by an intention **I**, within explicit constraints **C**.

This structure appears across competent work: reasoning, systems design, organizations, and software.

---

## The Engine

A transformation only matters if it can run.

SYNTRIAD uses a simple oscillation as its engine:

```
Ω = P ↔ V
```

- **P (Potential / Expansion):** generate options, interpretations, variants
- **V (Validation / Contraction):** select, test, constrain, discard

This expand–contract rhythm closes learning loops and prevents drift.

---

## Why It Works

The P,V-loop is not a workflow—it's a **cognitive primitive**.

Like AND/OR/NOT in logic, or nucleotides in DNA, the Production-Validation oscillation is the smallest stable unit from which any intelligent process can be constructed.

It works because:
1. **Oscillation creates convergence** — like a damped harmonic system
2. **Validation opposes drift** — like Lenz's Law in electromagnetism
3. **The structure is fractal** — same pattern at micro, meso, macro scales

The pattern doesn't guarantee intelligence. It creates the conditions under which intelligence can emerge.

---

## Sensitivity

When pattern and engine couple, a system becomes sensitive:

```
Sensitivity = Π ⊗ Ω
```

Sensitivity here means the capacity to:
- detect a meaningful difference
- move in response to it

No claims are made about intelligence as essence or consciousness as phenomenon.
This pattern only describes how work can be structured to respond, adapt, and improve.

That's it. The rest is application.

---

## The Five Phases

Every transformation decomposes into five sequential phases:

| Phase | Name | Function |
|------:|------|----------|
| Φ₁ | INTAKE | Gather state, intention, constraints |
| Φ₂ | DECOMPOSE | Break into atomic parts |
| Φ₃ | UNTANGLE | Resolve dependencies, make a plan |
| Φ₄ | TRANSFORM | Execute the plan |
| Φ₅ | OUTPUT | Assemble, validate, version (V++) |

Each phase can contain its own Φ₁–Φ₅ cycle.
Recursion stops when validation becomes trivial.

---

## What This Enables

Used consistently, the pattern helps to:

- standardize **process**, not content
- close learning loops (V++)
- reduce coordination friction
- make work auditable and replayable
- transfer structure across domains

If these effects matter, the pattern is useful.
If not, it can be ignored without consequence.

The structure is intentionally small.
Depth emerges through application, not explanation.

## Companion Repository

The SYNTRIAD pattern was applied to autonomous mathematical discovery — resulting in 9 proven theorems and 5 infinite families of digit-operation fixed points.
