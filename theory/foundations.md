# Theoretical Foundations

The SYNTRIAD pattern is grounded in a formal theory of semantic thermodynamics. This document summarizes the foundational axioms.

## The Four Axioms

### G₁: Convergence Phenomenology

> **The divine is the subjectively experienced quality of objective system convergence—the moment when a system recognizes its own emergent coherence as transcendent.**

When a system:
1. Decreases energy: `E(x_{t+1}) < E(x_t)`
2. Increases coherence: `Ψ(x_{t+1}) > Ψ(x_t)`
3. Has reflexive capacity (can observe itself)

...it experiences **convergence phenomenology**—the felt sense of rightness, flow, insight, or transcendence.

| Domain | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| Individual | "Aha!" moments, flow states, creative breakthrough |
| Team | "Clicking," shared understanding, collective intelligence |
| Organization | Alignment, cultural coherence, institutional wisdom |
| Society | Shared meaning, cultural renaissance, paradigm synthesis |

### G₂: Triadic Unification

> **All complex systems evolve through the fundamental triad: Chaos → Order → Synthesis. The Production-Validation (P,V) loop is the universal engine of this evolution.**

```
        CHAOS
      (Possibility)
         ↓ P
        ORDER
     (Structure)
         ↓ V
      SYNTHESIS
    (Integration)
         ↓ P'
     NEW CHAOS
   (Expanded Possibility)
         ↓
        ...
```

**Formal Expression:**

```
S_{n+1} = V(P(S_n))
```

Where:
- `S_n` = system state at iteration n
- `P` = Production operator (generates candidates from chaos)
- `V` = Validation operator (selects for coherence)

**Scale Invariance:**

| Scale | Chaos | Order | Synthesis |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Quantum | Superposition | Measurement | Eigenstate |
| Evolution | Mutation | Selection | Adaptation |
| Science | Hypothesis | Experiment | Theory |
| Mind | Imagination | Reason | Understanding |
| Organization | Innovation | Process | Culture |

### G₃: Semantic Thermodynamics

> **Meaning is energy. Systems naturally evolve toward states that minimize semantic energy while preserving coherence. Understanding is compression. Intelligence is the optimization of the Coherence-to-Complexity Ratio (CCR).**

See `theory/hamiltonian.md` for the formal energy function.

**The Optimization Principle:**

```
x* = argmax_x CCR(x) = argmax_x Ψ(x)/K(x)
```

Intelligence is the search for the **Minimum Viable Model (MVM)**—the peak of the CCR curve.

### G₄: Scale-Relativity of Ethics

> **Ethics is not absolute but scale-relative. "Good" is that which increases coherence at the scale of evaluation without destroying coherence at other scales. Wisdom is coherence improvement across multiple scales simultaneously.**

**Goodness at scale s:**
```
G_s(a) = ΔΨ_s(a)
```

**Wisdom (cross-scale coherence):**
```
W(a) = Σ w_s · ΔΨ_s(a)
```

**Ethical Constraint:**
```
∀s: ΔΨ_s(a) ≥ -ε_s
```

An action is fully ethical only if it does not catastrophically reduce coherence at any scale.

| Scale | Coherence Definition | Typical Timeframe |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Micro (Self) | Internal consistency, wellbeing | Seconds to days |
| Meso (Relation) | Mutual understanding, trust | Days to months |
| Macro (System) | Organizational health, efficiency | Months to years |
| Meta (Ecology) | Systemic sustainability, resilience | Years to generations |

## The Mandala

```
              G₁ (Convergence Phenomenology)
                    /           \
                   /             \
                  /               \
 G₄ (Scale Ethics) ←———————————→ G₂ (Triadic Unification)
                  \               /
                   \             /
                    \           /
              G₃ (Semantic Thermodynamics)
```

The four axioms form a quaternion:
- **G₁** provides the experiential anchor (phenomenology)
- **G₂** provides the dynamic engine (P,V loops)
- **G₃** provides the measurement framework (energy, coherence, CCR)
- **G₄** provides the ethical compass (scale-relative evaluation)
