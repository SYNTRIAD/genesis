# Contributing to SYNTRIAD

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This repository defines a **metapattern**.
Contributions are welcome as long as that distinction is respected.

---

## What Can Be Contributed

You are encouraged to contribute:

- examples (new domains, new applications)
- tooling built *on top of* the pattern
- documentation that clarifies usage
- integrations with other systems or workflows

These contributions extend the **phenotype**.

---

## What Should Not Be Changed

The following are considered **canonical** and should not be redefined:

- the transformation structure `T : (S, I, C) → S'`
- the P ↔ V execution rhythm
- the five phases Φ₁–Φ₅
- the role of V++ as a selection gate

These elements constitute the **genotype** of the pattern.

If you believe the canon itself is flawed, fork the repository.
Do not mutate the genotype in place.

---

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Apply the pattern in a new context
3. Keep the canonical structure intact
4. Submit a pull request with:
   - a clear description of the use case
   - the applied structure (UPS or equivalent)
   - an explicit validation step (V++)

Pull requests that demonstrate use are preferred over theoretical discussion.

---

## Style and Tone

- Be precise
- Be explicit about assumptions
- Prefer structure over prose
- Avoid metaphysical or promotional language

This repository values **operational clarity** over persuasion.

---

## Licensing

By contributing, you agree that your contributions are released under the same license as this repository.

Attribution will be preserved.

## Final Note

This is not a consensus-driven project.

The pattern is intentionally minimal and stable.
Evolution happens through application, not negotiation.

If the structure helps your work, use it.
If it does not, leave it untouched.
